Thank you for taking the time to contribute to toml4j! Here are a few guidelines to streamline the process.

* New or modified functionality MUST be covered by unit tests
* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Opening braces, parentheses, etc. are not on a new line

If you are unsure about how something should be implemented, open a pull request and we'll discuss it.
